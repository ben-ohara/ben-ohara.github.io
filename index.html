  The giant ground sloth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatherium">
  (Megatherium)</a> is an extict ancestor of the common ground sloth 
  that died out during the Pleistocene Era, where they were
  subsequently wiped out by humans due to their inability to defend 
  themselves from projectile weapons. They existed at the top of the 
  ice-age pecking order due to their immense attributes listed below:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mass - 4,000kg (8,800 lbs)</li>
    <li>Height - 6m (20ft)</li>
    <li>Strong tail - used as a tripod for extended reach </li>
    <li>Forelegs - Strong and clawed for defense as well
        as reach
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common ground Sloth</h3>

  Unlike its predecessor, the common ground sloth is stupid and slow,
  with almost no redeeming qualitites. Much like Koalas, sloths get
  almost no nutrition from their diet, despite evolving a complex 
  digestibe system. Which uses bacteria to break down leaves, sadly
  this bacteria can die if it gets too cold, meaning the sloth can starve
  on a full stomach.

 <h5>Dumb ways to die:</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>They have to poop on the ground leaving them vulnerable</li>
    <li>They clock out at 0.27km/h</li>
    <li>Harpy eagles using them as Target practice for their young</li>
    <li>As mentioned, dying from starvation on a full stomach</li>
  </ol>
