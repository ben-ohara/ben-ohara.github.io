<h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

<body>

<p>
  <ol>
<li class="blue-text">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>

<p>With how undecisive I can be, it's almost pointless for me to try and decide where I want to go with software development only 2-weeks into
the course. So although I do like the idea of app development right now, It's so hard to say where I'll end up.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>

<p>I feel as though I am a fairly good problem-solver which is vital when it comes to learning - 
specifically programming. But I also consider myself stubborn and tend to get bored easily. 
I feel like my goal should be to make sure I don't get burnt out by being too stubborn to ask 
for help/give up on a problem.</p>

<li class="blue-text">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>

<p>Like many others I do struggle with putting myself (and my work) out there for everyone to see, 
luckily I consider this a common enough fear that I don't feel as bothered sharing on the EDA 
Discord.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</li> 

<p>I've always been one to leave things to the last minute so I'm determined to make sure I stick 
to the time boxes and steadily work through the sprint as the week progresses. This will also 
ensure I don't burn out as easily. I don't consider myself a very stressful person, so when 
things build up I'm usually quite good at walking away from whatever is bothering me and giving 
myself time to reset. Although sometimes I put off coming back to the problem and I leave it to 
come and bite me in the ass.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>

<p>I'm lucky to have friends in and out of the course who can help me 
if I get desperate, but typically a cheeky google/youtube search will suffice for most issues.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li> 

<p>I like the idea of asking for help between students as it not only helps the one that is stuck 
but additionally its always good practice for those who know the content. But I expect the 
facilitation team to be there when we don't get an answer or it's a question that can't be 
answered by other students - so far they're onto it though so I imagine it won't be an issue.</p>


<li class="blue-text">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan 
these in.</li>

<p>luckily for me I was able to time work leave with the course so I wouldn't have to worry about money 
or work. That and I don't have too many responsibilities (no children, pets, etc). </p>
