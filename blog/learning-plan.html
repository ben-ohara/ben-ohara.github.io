<h1>My Learning Plan - Sprint 5:</h1>

<p>
  <ol>
<li class="blue-text">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>

<p>If/when (hopefully when) I finish bootcamp I Think I'll look into trying to secure a job that revolves more back-end programming, as much as I'm struggling with 
JS, I feel like it is more rewarding and enjoyable. I'm also not the most artistic person so I'm not sure how I would fare in a more design-based role.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>

<p>Other than unexpected issues in my personal life, I dont really have an excuse to not keep up in bootcamp, I've made sure I dont have any other responsibilities regarding work/
school. So I guess the biggest limitation will be my own comittment and discipline.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li>

<p>My main non-technical challenge will most likely be consistency, I need to make sure that the motivation that I have in week 1 is at the same point in week 9, especially
considering the incoming workload.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li> 

<p>I've always worked in environments where I am in a group/team but theres always room to improve considering the emphasis that the core work has had so far in foundations.
I think I need to make sure not to be embarrassed/hesitant when it comes to asking questions.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>

<p>To be helpful, friendly and supportive.  </p>

<li class="blue-text">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li> 

<p>Firstly, I expect myself to pass, as mentioned I dont really have a reason why I shouldnt be able to, I need to remember to not allow any excuses on my end.
I also expect to be patient with myself and allow myself time to take in all the information. I need to maintain a schedule or at least set a certain amount of time each day dedicated
to a certain task, and remain consistent. Finally, I expect myself to work constructively with others, allowing for mutual growth.

<h1>My Learning Plan - Sprint 2:</h1>

<body>

<p>
  <ol>
<li class="blue-text">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>

<p>With how undecisive I can be, it's almost pointless for me to try and decide where I want to go with software development only 2-weeks into
the course. So although I do like the idea of app development right now, It's so hard to say where I'll end up.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>

<p>I feel as though I am a fairly good problem-solver which is vital when it comes to learning - 
specifically programming. But I also consider myself stubborn and tend to get bored easily. 
I feel like my goal should be to make sure I don't get burnt out by being too stubborn to ask 
for help/give up on a problem.</p>

<li class="blue-text">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>

<p>Like many others I do struggle with putting myself (and my work) out there for everyone to see, 
luckily I consider this a common enough fear that I don't feel as bothered sharing on the EDA 
Discord.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</li> 

<p>I've always been one to leave things to the last minute so I'm determined to make sure I stick 
to the time boxes and steadily work through the sprint as the week progresses. This will also 
ensure I don't burn out as easily. I don't consider myself a very stressful person, so when 
things build up I'm usually quite good at walking away from whatever is bothering me and giving 
myself time to reset. Although sometimes I put off coming back to the problem and I leave it to 
come and bite me in the ass.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>

<p>I'm lucky to have friends in and out of the course who can help me 
if I get desperate, but typically a cheeky google/youtube search will suffice for most issues.</p>

<li class="blue-text">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li> 

<p>I like the idea of asking for help between students as it not only helps the one that is stuck 
but additionally its always good practice for those who know the content. But I expect the 
facilitation team to be there when we don't get an answer or it's a question that can't be 
answered by other students - so far they're onto it though so I imagine it won't be an issue.</p>


<li class="blue-text">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan 
these in.</li>

<p>luckily for me I was able to time work leave with the course so I wouldn't have to worry about money 
or work. That and I don't have too many responsibilities (no children, pets, etc). </p>
