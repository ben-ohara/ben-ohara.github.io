      <h3 class="blue-text">Neuroplasticty:</h3>
  
      <p>When people repeatedly practice an activity or access a memory, their neural networks -- groups of neurons that fire 
      together, creating electrochemical pathways -- shape themselves according to that activity or memory.  

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Neuroplasticity, or the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior, can help us more 
        thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-being–no matter our age.

        Neuroscientists used to think that the brain stopped developing in adolescence. That meant that any damage that 
        occurred to the brain in adulthood, such as loss of motor function because of a stroke, was permanent. However, as our 
        scientific knowledge advanced over the course of the 20th century, research on brain development and injury recovery 
        suggested the opposite. We now know that the brain is a highly active and malleable learning machine across a 
        person’s lifespan. This malleability is called neuroplasticity.

<h3 class="blue-text">Growth Mindset: </h3>
  <p class="p1">Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe 
    that even if they struggle with certain skills, their abilities aren’t set in stone. They think that with work, their 
    skills can improve over time. People with the opposite belief — that abilities are what they are and won’t change — 
    have a fixed mindset. They think their skills won’t improve no matter how hard they try.

  <p class="p1">Growth mindset is as much like EQ, being self-aware can hugely impact/benefit how you go about taking in 
    information as well as your mental state to do so. 'The power of yet' puts this into perspective as It delves 
    into the benefit of optimistic learning outlooks rather than assuming your brain just isn't designed to be good 
    at certain subjects:
