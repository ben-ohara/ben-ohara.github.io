<h1>My Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

    <p>I haven't had to make many big decisions in my life, one that comes to mind was when I left 
    all of my friends and what life I had in Christchurch to move to Wellington. I'm sure it's 
    not the most dramatic thing but it was a bit of an impulse decision that left others a bit 
    hurt/offended. Ultimately I prioritised my mental health over any other consequence. 
    Luckily on my end it worked out well but there was definitely some drama that came with me 
    just ditching all of my close friends and job. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>My parents are very different in a lot of their ideologies but they both tried to make sure I stayed 
    (relatively) selfless and honest. Although I've learnt there are times you need to put yourself first. </p>
    

<li class="blue-text">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</li>

<p>'Virtuosos are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions (though perhaps not always 
solutions to practical problems). No other type is quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, 
and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results.'</p>
<br>

<p>'Perhaps most important to Virtuosos though, is the feeling that they arent stuck. The freedom to wander, the 
freedom to declare their own schedules, their own responsibilities, their own environments' - Taken from 
16personalities</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I think both of these traits play into software development, the problem solving aspect as well as the demand as a 
career being able to take you almost anywhere.</p>


<li class="blue-text">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</li>
<p>At one of my old jobs  there would be multiple occasions where I would 'clash' with particular co-workers. 
  After working there for so long, they had settled, wanting  to do the bare minumum and leave any difficult job to 
  others. I ended up asking management if I could be moved to another department where I enjoyed myself much more.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I'm not sure if I would go about the situation much differently if given the opportunity again. If anything, 
  I would ask to be moved earlier.</p>
