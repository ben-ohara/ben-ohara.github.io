      <h3 class="blue-text">JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
  
      <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are regarded as the 3 'Foundational' coding languages of
      the internet. HTML is a markup language (Hyper Text Markup Language to be specific),
      CSS is a styling language - describes how HTML elements are displayed on-screen,
      and JavaScript is a scripting language which allows the user to integrate dynamic
      content, control media such as images and video along with a long list of other
      content</p>
      <br>
      <p>An analogy to describe the three of them could be if you were to think of a website
        as a grocery store: HTML is the building and all the 'framework' inside; including the shelves and 
        counters, along with the products to be sold. CSS is the layout of the shelves and counters within 
        the store, the arrangement of products on the shelves along with the paint and decorations. 
        JavaScript is the employees that operate the store so you can walk in and buy things.

<h3 class="blue-text">The <b>DOM</b></h3>
  
  <p class="p1">The DOM (Document Object Model) provides the means to interact with elements on an html document. 
    It is the way through which JavaScript interacts with content within a website.  </p>

    <p class="p1">Using DOM, JavaScript can perform multiple tasks. It can create new elements and attributes, 
      change the existing elements and attributes and even remove existing elements and attributes. </p>
    <p class="p1">A more in-depth explaination below:</p>

<h3 class="blue-text">Control Flow and Loops</h3>
<p class="p1">Control Flow is essentially how your computer reads your code, much like how everyone reads - top to bottom.
  This order that the code is run can however be disrupted by structures that change the flow - such as conditionals
  or loops.
</p>
<br>
<p>Looking at loops in partiucular: loops will continuously run a section of code until a speficied condition is met. 
  For an example you could say that the condition is rolling a 6 on a set of numbers between 1-6. The loop will continue to 'roll'
  the until the random number generator pulls a 6.  
</p>

<h3 class="blue-text">Arrays vs Objects</h3>
  <p>Using square brackets in the code to indicate an array, they are how we compile a list in JS. When looking at the contents
    of an array, we need to remember to 'start counting from 0' so that even if there 5 strings in an array, the program will
    see that as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. So if we were to use colours as an example: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange'], the 
    word 'orange' would actually be '4' in the array even though it is the 5th number.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>An Object is a collection of related data. This data is referred to as <e>properties</e> and <em>methods</em> when 
  inside an object. Where the slight difference between Objects and Arrays comes when retriving it in the code. As mentioned,
  when retriving from an array, the program will count between a set of numbers, so using 'console.log([x])' will give you
  one of the properties from an array where as 'console.log(OBJECTNAME.OBJECTPROPERTY)' will end in the same result.</p>
