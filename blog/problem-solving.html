      <h3 class="blue-text">Time I was blocked by a problem:</h3>
  
      <p> A time I was blocked by a problem was literally yesterday when I was working through
      the 'Built-in Methods' portion of sprint-4. I purposefully tried to stay off the discord
      in order to work through the issue on my own.

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I integrated a few of the problem solving techniques that we looked at earlier this week. Using [programming 
      language] how to [do a particular thing], it was pretty easy to find the resources I needed, then it was just a matter 
      of applying the examples given, to my code. There was a time where I also implemented the rubber ducky method, replacing
      the rubber duck with my girlfriend who wasn't at all listening - which seemed to work well. Ususally through ranting about
      a problem, you'll find a simple solution.
      </p>

<h3 class="blue-text">Elegantly solved a problem: </h3>
  <p class="p1">If I'm honest, the time I was blocked by a problem and the time I solved a problem was in the same instance,
    the built-in methods section of the Kata excercises forced me to implement these problem solving techniques. Which lead 
    to me successfully passing all the given tests.

  <p class="p1">I learnt that it is definitely easier to talk to my peers when I get stuck, but also that I don't have to 
    depend on them when I encounter an issue, trusty google is always there to fall back on.
