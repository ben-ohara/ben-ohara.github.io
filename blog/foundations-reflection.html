<h1>Foundations Reflection:</h1>

<p>
  <ol>
<li class="blue-text">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</li>

<p>The first thing would be that I had to absolutely put my ego aside - I like to use the empty cup analogy. Secondly I was surprised at how unbothered I was when encountering
an issue, not to the point of not caring, but rather just walking though step-by-step/asking for help. Lastly I had to be more comfortable asking for help which is something that 
I usually struggle with.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</li>

<p>I think ampathy and values definitely dictate how we treat others, during times in foundations I found myself feeling like a burden when asking for help but realised that when others 
asked something of me, I was able to relate so well due to being in the same position. I think it also ties into your ego and not allowing youself to get a big head just because you're
understanding something someone else isnt.
<br>
<br>
Self-awareness is a key aspect of emotional intellegence, how we perceive ourselves and our emotions. It allows us to control our emotions. This is extremely useful in not just in the 
context of programming but in all aspects of life.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>

<p>If I'm honest I didnt think I would enjoy it as much as I have. I would have probably said its silly or almost cringe. But it has genuinely helped me at points of the foundations and 
I'm sure a lot of other times going forward.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li> 

<p>I seemed to find the core learning much easier than the tech-side of the foundations. But if I were to pick something that was the <i>most</i> difficult it would probably be anytime where
I had to face my weaknesses, its a bit of a necessary evil if you want to constructively critise yourself and your work.
</p>

<li class="blue-text">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</li>

<p>Again, if you were to ask me that at the start of the course I would have said yes, but I like the balance of Core:Tech, it made the tech feel like less of a grind.</p>

<li class="blue-text">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</li> 

<p>No, I think if you were to just try and cram in as much technical work in as possible without any core, we wouldnt be able to process all the information anyway. The core work (in my opinion)
give us a break from the coding and teaches us important aspects of programming as a career, while also stimulating our brains and integrating key attributes for being a career software developer.
