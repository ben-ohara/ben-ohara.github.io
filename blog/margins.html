<h1>Margins, Padding and Borders</h1>
<h3>And a brief distinction between them</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div></div>
<body>
<p>Margin: A margin in CSS and HTML is defined as the space <b>AROUND</b> an element. It could
be considered as the 'outer-most layer'. Margins can be customised by selecting to increase
the space between any given side of the content. For example on this webpage, I've
opted to have a 20 pixel margin on the <b>left</b> of all text and images.
</p>
<br>
<p>Padding: The padding is the space between the <em>content</em> (eg text) and the <em>border</em>. 
This is indicated in orange on the image below. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Border: Again, as seen on the image below, the dark purple border sits between
the margin and the padding. If there was no padding, the border would sit flush against
the content - I've indicated this below using a pink border on the image itself, with no padding.
</p>

<p>To summarise the difference bewteen them as simply as possible. Think of the content, 
padding, border, and margin as layers on a gobstopper lolly. Working your way in from
the outermost layer (the margin) through the padding, to get to the border and finally
the content in the middle. Each of these layers can be customised, but the order which
you need to get through them remains the same.
